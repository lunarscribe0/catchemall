                    Starting with Stadium may seem unconventional, but there is good reason to do so. By clearing the game's
                    Poke Cup and Prime Cups, you can unlock the Doduo and Dodrio Game Boy Tower features, which allow you to
                    play Pokemon Red, Blue, or Yellow using the N64 Transfer Pak at double or triple speed respectively. This
                    can make grinding and other time-consuming activities go by much quicker, making the challenge of beating
                    the cups with Rental Pokemon very worth it. In addition, this serves as a great introduction to the battle
                    system of Generation 1  within an environment that allows for some experimentation in Pokemon and type
                    choice.
